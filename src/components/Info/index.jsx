        I am a software engineer passionate about helping companies deliver
        great client experiences. I take insight from my experience in
        client-facing roles and have merged them with my technical skills as an
        engineer. I am a problem solver who strives under pressure and looks at
        every problem as an opportunity to learn and grow. I adjust and adapt to
        any situation to help my teammates and myself grow and achieve results
        to create the best product.
